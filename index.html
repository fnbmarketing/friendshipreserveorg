          Welcome to Friendship Reserve, a social network dedicated to promoting the importance of friendship and community building. At Friendship Reserve, we recognize the significant role that friendship plays in our lives, both personally and professionally. We understand that friendships are not only essential for our well-being but also for our economic success. That's why we have created a social credit system where the more friends you have, the more social credits you earn, which can be redeemed for rewards and benefits.
      </p>
      <p class="lead mb-5" style="padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%;">
          At Friendship Reserve, we believe in the economy of friendship, which is based on the exchange of social capital.
